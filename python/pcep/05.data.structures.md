# Data Collections

A data type that can hold more than one variable.

- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries

## Lists

List indices start at 0.

```
empty_list = []

cites = ['Chicago', 'New York City', 'Los Angeles', 'Las Vegas', 'Miami']

print(cities[0]) = Chicago
print(cities[-1]) = Miami
```

Slicing can return a range of elements from a list.

cities[0:2] returns ['Chicago', 'New York City']

cities[3:] returns everything starting at index 3

cities[10:15] returns []

**Deleting elements from List**

```
del cities[2]

del cities[3:]

del cities (will delete the cities variable entirely)
```

**Add elements to List**

```
cities.append('Denver')
```

insert a new value at a specific index

```
cities.insert(1, 'Minneapolis')
```

**Iterating Lists**

Lists are sequences that can be iterated over.

```
for city in cities:
    print(city)
```

If you need the index of the iterator:

```
for city_index in range(len(cities)):
    print('Index:', city_index, ' - City:', cities[city_index])
```

**Change Element Positions**

To swap variables.

```
first = 1
second = 2

first, second = second, first
```

To swap list elements. Apply the same method.

```
cities[0], cities[1] = cities[1], cities[0]
```

Sorting elements alphabetically or numerically can be done with a list method.

```
cities.sort()

nums = [1,5,4,3,2]
nums.sort() returns [1,2,3,4,5]
```

nums.sort(reverse=True) to order from largest to smallest.

<listname>.sort() will sort original list. To create a new, sorted list, use the sorted function:

new_list = sorted(cities)

**Check element presence**

```
if 'New York City' in cities:
	print('Yea!')
```

**Copying Lists**

With complex data collections, like Lists, the variable points to a place in memory.

cities2 = cities, will point to same place in memory. Changing one element in one list will change the value in the other list.

To actually copy a list into a new variable, use slicing. Then you can copy the original list, or parts of it.

cities2 = cities[:]

**List Comprehension**

You can think of a list comprehension as creating a list from the return values of a for loop, function, or line of code.

To create a list of 100 integers.

```
numbers = [i for i in range(1, 101)]
```

To create a list of 100 integers and skip those divisible by 3.

```
numbers = [i for i in range(1, 101) if i % 3 != 0]
```

**Nested Lists**

You can have lists that contain other lists as elements.

```
cells = [['A1', 'A2', 'A3'],['B1', 'B2', 'B3']]

cells[0] = ['A1', 'A2', 'A3']

cells[0][0] = 'A1'
```

To loop through all elements in cells:

```
for x in cells:
	for y in x:
		print(y)
```

**Adding and Multiplying Lists**

cities2 = ['Seattle', 'Portland']
cities_all = cities + cities2

```nums = [1,2] * 2``` will return [1,2,1,2]

**More String Features**

Indexing and slicing works on strings too.

band = 'Green Day'
print(band[:6]) will print: Green

Strings do NOT support item assignment (band[4] = 'M'). However, string have other methods.

band.upper() = GREEN DAY
band.isnumeric() = False

Read the documentation for more examples.

## Tuples

Identified by parentheses. They are good when all the elements are of the same type or related items.

```
empty_tuple = ()

tuple_a = (1,)
tuple_b = 1,
tuple_c = 1, 2, 3
```

Lists are mutable. Tuples are not. But you can assign a new tuple to the old tuple variable. But you cannot add new elements to a tuple.

Strings are also immutable. You cannot change the existing string.

**Tuple Operations**

Get the length of a tuple:

len(tuple_a) returns 1

Check if element is in tuple:

```
if 1 in tuple_a:
    print('Yay!')
```

Add and multiply tuples:

tuple_a + tuple_b returns a new tuple with all values

**Mixing with Lists**

```
city_1 = ('London', 'UK', 8.98)
city_2 = ('Canberra', 'Australia', 0.4)
city_3 = ('Algiers', 'Algeria', 3.9)

capitals = [city_1, city_2, city_3]
```

Put a list inside a tuple. You can still modify that list even though it's inside a tuple.

```
user_data = ('Noel', 'British', 1964, [77.0, 78.2, 77.5])
user_data[3].append(79.6)
```

## Dictionaries

Key-value data structure.

```
emails = {
	'Anne': 'anne@gmail.com',
	'John': 'john@gmail.com',
	'Mark': 'mark@gamil.com'
}

print(emails['Anne'])

emails['Joe'] = 'joe@gmail.com'

print(emails['Liam']) - returns error
```

The keys can be of other data types, like integers, tuples, etc, but not lists. The key must be immutable.

**Dictionary Operations**

```
grades = {}

grades['Anne'] = 'A-'
grades['John'] = 'B'

grades['Anne'] = 'B+'
grades.update({'John':'A'})

len(grades) - returns 2

if 'John' in grades:
    print(grades['John'])

del grades['John']

for key in grades:
	print(key)

for key in grades.keys():
	print(key)
	
for value in grades.values():
	print(value)

for key, value in grades.items():
	print(key, value)
```
