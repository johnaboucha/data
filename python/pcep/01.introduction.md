# Introduction

Python is one of the most popular general-purpose programming languages. It’s easy to learn and free to use.

Some popular software written in Python include Spotify, Instagram, Dropbox, and Reddit. You can also use Python for data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. It can also be used to automate tasks on your computer and monitor IoT devices.

## Software Tools

To write python programs, you can use basic text editors like Notepad, TextEdit, and others but there are more advanced editors available called Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that can make the programming process easier and more enjoyable. Some examples include PyCharm and Visual Studio Code.

## Python Interpreter

After you write your code, you need some way to translate those Python instructions into real computer commands. The Python interpreter can be installed on your desktop or laptop computers from the python.org website. However, there is a more convenient solution for beginners.

Anaconda is a suite of software applications that include Python, a built-in python interpreter, and a nice application called Jupyter Notebooks. You just need to download and install one thing and you’ll be set.

## Anaconda

To get Anaconda, visit [https://www.anaconda.com/](https://www.anaconda.com/) and download the Anaconda Distribution for your operating system. You can find this in the menu under Products > Anaconda Distribution and click the Download button. Run the installer. Choosing all the default options are recommended.

Once installed, the Anaconda Navigator now appears in your Applications folder. When you open that you should see a list of software tools available to you. The one we are interested in is Jupyter Notebook. Click Launch. The software runs locally on your computer, in the web browser. It doesn’t require an internet connection to run.

## Online Environment

There are also a variety of online tools to run python as well without having to install anything on your computer.
