# Exceptions

Syntax errors are easy to identify and fix. However, there are sometimes errors that are not easy to anticipate. For example, if a user enters invalid data.

Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program.

```
try:
	value = int(input('Enter an integer: '))
	print('The inverse of', value, 'is', 1/value)
except ValueError:
	print('You entered an invalid number.')
except ZeroDivisionError:
	print('Division by 0 is not possible')
except:
	print('An error occured')
```

Exception errors cannot be specified more than once.

There are over 60 built-in exception types. Examples include: ZeroDivisionError, IndexError, TypeError, ValueError, SystemExit, etc..

The SystemExit exception occurs when the Python module and method is called:

sys.exit()

The KeyboardInterrupt exception occurs when we manually stop the Python script from executing.

Exceptions are propagated through functions in Python. If a function raises an exception, it passes it up the call-chain to the function that called it.

**Assertions** are assumption in our program that we think are true. They are useful for debugging and documenting your code. They should not be used to validate user input.

```
def calc_inverse(number):
	assert (number != 0), 'Got 0 as a number!'
	return 1/number
```

If number is 0, the program raises an AssertionError and displays your error string.
