# Flow Control

## IF Statements

If a given statement is True, execute a block of code. Note the indentation. The recommendation is to use 4 spaces, or a tab, for all the indentation.

```
age = 30
if age > 30:
    print('Geezer!')
elif age < 10:
	print('Kid!')
else:
	print('Dude!')
```

Conditional statements use '==' to check equality. Variable assignments use the single '='.

Other Logical Operators include:
- <, less than, >, greater than
- <=, less than or equal, >=, greater than or equal
- ==, equals
- !=, not equals

```
if 2 == 2:
	print('true') # will print true

if 2 == 2.0:
	print('true') # will also print true
```

## Joining Multiple Conditions

AND, OR, NOT

```
if user_age < 25 and user_country == 'Germany':
    print('You can apply for German student exchange program')


if country == 'Canada' or country == 'United States' or country == 'Mexico':
    print('You are in North America')
	
if not country == 'United States':
    print('You need a work permit')
```

Order of Priority:
1. not
2. and
3. or

## Nested IF Statements

```
if traveling == True:
    if vehicle == 'Car':
	    print('Stick hand out the window to hand surf')
	else:
	    print('Wait patiently')
else:
    print('Dude, lets take a drive')
```

## While Loop

While loops repeat a block of instructions more while a condition is true.

```
counter = 1

while counter < 11:
	print(counter)
	counter += 1
print('Done')
```

## For Loop

Good for iterating through elements in a sequence.

```

for letter in 'fart':
    print(letter)

for counter in range(1,11):
    print(counter)

same as the following becaues range starts at 0 by default, or use a range(start, stop), or range(start, stop, skip)

for counter in range(10):
    print(counter+1)

```

## Break and Continue

Break will let you stop a loop

```
while True:
    guess = int(input('Enter a number'))
	if guess == 5:
	    print('You win')
		break
	print('keep guessing')
```

Continue is used to skip the rest of the block within a loop and continue the next iteration.

```
for i in range (10):
    if i == 7:
	    continue
	print(i)
```

## Other Loop Features

Loops require at least one instruction inside the code block. If you want to skip the loop and not throw errors, enter: pass. Also good inside of IF statements and so on.

```
for i in range(11):
    pass
```

Loops can be used inside other loops.

For and While statements can include an Else statement that is always executed **once** after the loop condition is no longer met.

```
i = 5
while i < 5:
    print(i)
	i += 1
else:
    print('else:', i)
```
