# Flow Control

## IF Statements

If a given statement is True, execute a block of code. Note the indentation. The recommendation is to use 4 spaces, or a tab, for all the indentation.

```
age = 30
if age > 30:
    print('Geezer!')
elif age < 10:
	print('Kid!')
else:
	print('Dude!')
```

Conditional statements use '==' to check equality. Variable assignments use the single '='.

Other Logical Operators include:
- <, less than
- >, greater than
- <=, less than or equal
- >=, greater than or equal
- ==, equals
- !=, not equals

```
if 2 == 2:
	print('true') # will print true

if 2 == 2.0:
	print('true') # will also print true
```
