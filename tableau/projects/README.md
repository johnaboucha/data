### Visualizing Citibike Trips

In this [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/visualizing-citibike-trips-tableau) project-based course on visualizing Citibike trips with Tableau, the basics of data visualization were used to analyze a subset of the popular Citibike trips datasets from February 2018. This project covered how to import data, understand measures and dimensions, understand work-spaces, use filters, use sheets, and create and export dashboards.

The visualization is available on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/john.boucha8593/viz/CitibikeTrips_16614443637840/Dashboard).
